                <h3>One of the best NES games</h3>
                <p>First released in 1988. Absolute game changer for the time, it is objectively the best game. Ever. No contest. Got countless rereleases. </p>
                <p>Freaking awesome game, 10/10, must play. </p>
                <p>Really showed the capabilities of the NES. Used some extra RAM on the cartridge to handle stuff like diagonal scrolling.</p>

                <p>Super cool game, finally Peach gets to star in this DS exclusive. Mario being an idiot so he gets kidnapped. skill issue</p>
                <p>Main gimmick is controlling Peach's 4 emotions (???? okay) but the mechanic is pretty cool and allows for a puzzle aspect</p>
                <p>ehmmmmmm yeah really unique platformer, Nintendo should do more of this kinda stuff, get creative</p>

                <h3>Dinosaur Land ðŸ˜Ž</h3>
                <p>Mario's new adventure in Dinosaur land. First time they managed to add Yoshi without breaking the game. SNES 16-bit architecture allowed for more cool shit.</p>
                <p>Also first time we saw the spin-jump. This became a mario game staple.</p>
                <p>Last main-line 2D mario game for a loooong while. The sequel of this game is not a Mario game but a Yoshi game, N64 got the first 3D game, GameCube continued that. GBA only got rereleases and finally in 2006 we got New Supe. which was a good game but they shouldn't have recycled the formula like million times ughhh so tired</p>

                <h3>Best Donkey Kong version!!</h3>
                <p>Donkey Kong (alternatively Game Boy Donkey Kong, and Donkey Kong '94 in early development) is a Game Boy game released in 1994 by Nintendo. The game starts out with the premise of the original 1981 Donkey Kong arcade game. However, this game qualifies as both an extension and a standalone title; it features 97 stages beyond its original premise. It acts as a predecessor to Mario vs. Donkey Kong. </p>

                <h3>Cool GB cartridge tech</h3>
                <p>The game uses a four-way tilt sensor allowing the user to "roll" Kirby by tilting the Game Boy Color. The goal is to guide Kirby to the finish by tilting the Game Boy in the direction where the player desires to move him. The game uses a "pop" action, when the player jerks the Game Boy vertically. This makes Kirby jump up into the air, which transforms all on-screen enemies into stars. Popping a second time will turn the stars into clocks, and popping a third time will turn the clocks into Power Drinks.</p>

                <h3>Best rhythm games series</h3>
                <p>Rhythm Tengoku is a rhythm game similar to the WarioWare series of video games due in part to its simplistic controls and art style. Due to Rhythm Tengoku being similar to the WarioWare series, it includes a reference to Orbulon's Alien Bunnies or also known originally as Space Hares are used as a replacement for the Squadmates from the minigame Marching Orders in the sequel for Marching Orders, Marching Orders 2. Rhythm Tengoku features eight sets which consist of six rhythm games each (all of which are unique to each other). Each set's sixth stage is a remix of the previous games all at once. </p>

                <h3>Best 3D Zelda game</h3>
                <p>The Wind Waker is notable for being the first game in the series to employ cel-shading, a lighting and texturing technique that results in the game having a cartoon-like appearance. It also differentiates itself from other Zelda games with its massive Overworld, the Great Sea, which must be explored using a boat, the King of Red Lions. It is an indirect sequel to Ocarina of Time,[6] taking place several hundred years after the events of the previous games.</p>

                <h3>Tetris to the masses</h3>
                <p>This version of Tetris includes a two-player mode, in which each player's objective is to remain in play for longer than their opponent. Each player plays with a separate Game Boy and Tetris Game Pak, with the two consoles connected via the Game Link Cable. When a player scores a Double, Triple, or Tetris, incomplete rows of blocks are added to the bottom of the opponent's stack, causing it to rise.</p>
